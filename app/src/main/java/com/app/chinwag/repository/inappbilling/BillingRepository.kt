     * BACKGROUND
     *
     * Google Play Billing refers to receipts as [Purchases][Purchase]. So when a user buys
     * something, Play Billing returns a [Purchase] object that the app then uses to release the
     * [Entitlement] to the user. Receipts are pivotal within the [BillingRepositor]; but they are
     * not part of the repo’s public API, because clients don’t need to know about them. When
     * the release of entitlements occurs depends on the type of purchase. For consumable products,
     * the release may be deferred until after consumption by Google Play; for non-consumable
     * products and subscriptions, the release may be deferred until after
     * [BillingClient.acknowledgePurchaseAsync] is called. You should keep receipts in the local
     * cache for augmented security and for making some transactions easier.
     *
     * THIS METHOD
     *
     * [This method][queryPurchasesAsync] grabs all the active purchases of this user and makes them
     * available to this app instance. Whereas this method plays a central role in the billing
     * system, it should be called at key junctures, such as when user the app starts.
     *
     * Because purchase data is vital to the rest of the app, this method is called each time
     * the [BillingViewModel] successfully establishes connection with the Play [BillingClient]:
     * the call comes through [onBillingSetupFinished]. Recall also from Figure 4 that this method
     * gets called from inside [onPurchasesUpdated] in the event that a purchase is "already
     * owned," which can happen if a user buys the item around the same time
     * on a different device.
